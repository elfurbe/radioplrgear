# Mixers
Generally speaking, a mixer will allow you to control the relative volume of different audio sources and output the combined signal. They come in a few flavors. The traditional [all-analog mixer](#analog-mixers), digital-analog [hybrid mixers](#hybrid-mixers), and pure [digital mixers](#digital-mixers). This section is specifically about mixers with dedicated hardware for mix control. You can find pure software mixers in the [software](software.md) section. All mixers will have some number of inputs and outputs, often some number of send/receive loops for off-board processing and some sort of controls in the form of faders and knobs to adjust various properties of the sound.

## Analog Mixers
This is 100% your daddy's mixer. Sound comes in on audio cables, it goes out on audio cables. All mixing is done in the analog domain and digitizing the output is your problem to solve with an [interface](#interfaces). Pure analog mixers are less common now at the lower end of the price spectrum, but there are still purists that will accept nothing less, one of which is noted pedantic dbag ElFurbe. Things to concern yourself with on an analog mixer:
 - Input and output types/channels:
  - How many microphones do you need to run at once?
  - What other sources do you need to bring in/out?
  - How will your digital [interface](#interfaces) connect?
 - Quality of microphone pre-amps
  - Does your microphone require phantom power?
  - Does your microphone require high input gain?
  - Does the pre-amp color the sound at all?
 - Ergonomics of controls
  - Are the controls you definitely need available?
  - Are the controls you need easy to find and operate?

#### Current Model Products

##### Behringer 502

AKA The Bare Minimum. One mic input, all knobs, low complication. At this control level you're probably able to do what you need to do with just an [interface](#interfaces), but maybe you want this anyway to keep the mixing separate. Several Radio PLR DJs use this mixer or its slightly larger brethren ([802](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog-Mixers/802/p/P0575), [1202](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog-Mixers/1202/p/P0573), etc). The only difference is more inputs.

ElFurbe's Editorial: I find the sound of Behringer Xenyx microphone pre-amps abhorrent. They have what Behringer refers to as a "vintage British" sound which seems to mean "muddy, noisy, and mid-range spiked". I tried one of Behringer's [hybrids](#hybrid-mixers) personally, and in addition to finding the integrated audio [interface](#interfaces) a real nightmare and the build quality a little plasticky for my taste, the pre-amps were hellish. I have a lower-end but good quality [microphone](#microphones) and by the time I got enough gain out of it on the board, the noise floor was intolerable; I was recording more hiss than signal. Now, what's important to keep in mind is that I'm literally the worst, picky about everything and on the whole striving for a level of quality that no one reasonable would care about. Will this mixer allow you to plug in a microphone and output the noises you make into that microphone out to something else: yes. It definitely will.

##### Mackie ProFX4v2

http://mackie.com/products/profxv2-series

Mackie. They're a big name, particularly in gigging/travel gear. They're known to be tough and you'll find plenty of road audio techs that swear by them. The ProFX4v2 is the entry level model and essentially comparable to the Behringer 802 in every important way.

ElFurbe's Editorial: Mackie ProFX pre-amps are great. They're not as good as Mackie's Onyx line, but they're dramatically superior to Behringer's Xenyx monstrosities. I almost test drove one of their ProFX8v2 [hybrids](#hybrid-mixers) but the nice man at Guitar Center told me he'd had several returns on that specific model, so I decided to skip it entirely. Also the shape of the faders is odd. Not, like, "don't buy it" odd, but odd enough I noticed it.

##### Alto ZMX52

https://www.altoproaudio.com/products/zmx52

Alto is a name you won't hear as much as Behringer or Mackie, but many audio professionals would recognize it. The ZMX52 is comparable to the Behringer [502](#behringer-502) above. The [ZMX862](ZMXhttps://www.altoproaudio.com/products/zmx862) is the next step up, comparable to the Mackie [ProFX4v2](#mackie-profx4v2) or the Behringer 802.

ElFurbe's Editorial: Alto's pre-amps are sublime. The gain adjustment was a little skewed low so I had to really crank it up to get good levels out of my mic, but even in that scenario the channel was jet black. I had one of Alto's larger [hybrids](#hybrid-mixers) for a test run at home and the analog audio quality was fantastic. The controls were great, the feel was great, it was all great. Their built-in USB interface, much like all built-in USB interfaces at this price-tier, was a real garbage fire. I have no doubt these smaller mixers without the USB hardware will sound magnificent. I almost talked myself into keeping the Alto board and adding another audio interface, but I got indignant about their lack of fucks given to the digital interface and decided they could go straight to hell.

##### Soundcraft EPM8
![Soundcraft EPM8](https://adn.harmanpro.com/product_attachments/product_attachments/1985_1422315863/EPM8-Top_original.jpg) https://www.soundcraft.com/en/products/epm8

Soundcraft is a brand you would see in a professional radio booth. Their history is long, their reputation is stellar, their quality is top notch and their faders feel sublime. The smallest all-analog mixer Soundcraft makes is the EPM8, but you're still getting all the good things about a Soundcraft analog mixer in a small package.

Elfurbe's Editorial: I have not used this mixer personally, but my understanding is that the microphone pre-amps are jet black with a virtually inaudible noise floor at high gain and no color at all. The ergo is great, wonderful fader feel, all the knobs a person could want. I (ElFurbe) almost bought this mixer, but I went a different way at the 11th hour.

#### Used Gear Worth Considering

##### Mackie Onyx line
Mackie's step-up line from the ProFX series is the Onyx. This is a line still in production, but the price increase for new gear is pretty dramatic and for our purposes not really worth it. Also the newer models have high-quality built-in audio interfaces, but it's "pro" series gear so that means Firewire, in most cases. On the other hand, older generation Onyx gear can be found on eBay or Craigslist in good shape and the quality of the analog components is still fantastic.

ElFurbe's Editorial: I specifically added this section because this is exactly what I did. I bought a used [Onyx 1220](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/mackie-onyx-1220-12-channel-mixer) from eBay from a seller with a solid reputation. The board was taken out of an installation in a church when they did renovation to their audio equipment and it was in pristine condition. I paid ~$175 for it. It is huge, it is overkill of the highest order, it was the wrong choice in every practical sense and I love it with my whole body. Onyx pres are choice as hell, the entire board feels like it means business and the sound quality I get out of it is banana pancakes good. Should you do this? Almost certainly no. Am I happy with it, oh hells yes.
