# Mixers
Generally speaking, a mixer will allow you to control the relative volume of different audio sources and output the combined signal. They come in a few flavors. The traditional [all-analog mixer](#analog-mixers), digital-analog [hybrid mixers](#hybrid-mixers), and pure [digital mixers](#digital-mixers). This section is specifically about mixers with dedicated hardware for mix control. You can find pure software mixers in the [software](software.md) section. All mixers will have some number of inputs and outputs, often some number of send/receive loops for off-board processing and some sort of controls in the form of faders and knobs to adjust various properties of the sound.

## Analog Mixers
This is 100% your daddy's mixer. Sound comes in on audio cables, it goes out on audio cables. All mixing is done in the analog domain and digitizing the output is your problem to solve with an [interface](#interfaces). Pure analog mixers are less common now at the lower end of the price spectrum, but there are still purists that will accept nothing less, one of which is noted pedantic dbag ElFurbe. Things to concern yourself with on an analog mixer:
 - Input and output types/channels:
  - How many microphones do you need to run at once?
  - What other sources do you need to bring in/out?
  - How will your digital [interface](#interfaces) connect?
 - Quality of microphone pre-amps
  - Does your microphone require phantom power?
  - Does your microphone require high input gain?
  - Does the pre-amp color the sound at all?
 - Ergonomics of controls
  - Are the controls you definitely need available?
  - Are the controls you need easy to find and operate?

AKA The Bare Minimum. One mic input, all knobs, low complication. At this control level you're probably able to do what you need to do with just an [interface](#interfaces), but maybe you want this anyway to keep the mixing separate. Several Radio PLR DJs use this mixer or its slightly larger brethren ([802](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog-Mixers/802/p/P0575), [1202](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog-Mixers/1202/p/P0573), etc). The only difference is more inputs.

ElFurbe's Editorial: I find the sound of Behringer microphone pre-amps abhorrent. Even a good mic can sound bad on a Behringer pre. The "Xenyx" pre-amp has what they refer to as a "vintage British" sound which seems to mean "muddy, noisy, and mid-range spiked". I tried one of Behringer's [hybrids](#hybrid-mixers) personally and in addition to finding the integrated audio [interface](#interfaces) a real nightmare and the build quality a little plasticky for my taste, the pre-amps were hellish. I have a lower-end but good quality [microphone](#microphones) and by the time I got enough gain out of it on the board, the noise floor was intolerable. I was recording more hiss than sound. Now what's important to keep in mind is that I'm literally the worst, picky about everything and on the whole striving for a level of quality that no one reasonable would care about.

##### Soundcraft EPM8

Soundcraft is a brand you would see in a professional radio booth. Their history is long, their reputation is stellar, their quality is top notch and their faders feel sublime. The smallest all-analog mixer Soundcraft makes is the EPM8, but you're still getting all the good things about a Soundcraft analog mixer in a small package. I (Elfurbe) have not used this mixer personally, but my understanding is that the microphone pre-amps are jet black with virtually zero noise floor at high gain and no color at all. The ergo is great, wonderful fader feel, all the knobs a person could want. I (ElFurbe) almost bought this mixer, but I went a different way in the 11th hour.
