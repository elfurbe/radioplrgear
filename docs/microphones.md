# Microphones
A good mic is important to getting good sound from your mouth hole to the jerks on the other end of the internet. You can spend lots of money on a microphone but there are diminishing returns pretty rapidly above ~$100 and you'll likely need higher-grade interfaces and mixers to get real value out of it and in the end you're encoding to MP3 for streaming so basically what I'm getting at is this: don't splurge on the microphone, just get a good one and you'll be fine.

In terms of the mechanical method they use to capture sound, there are really only two sorts of mics to consider.
  - [Dynamic](#dynamic)
  - [Condenser](#condenser)
  
In terms of the effective capture area in space around the microphone, you'll generally find either omnidirectional or cardioid pattern microphones. Omnidirectional is pretty self-explanatory, it basically means you should expect all sound from any direction to capture at the same level. Cardioid microphones are more sensitive from one direction than from the opposite. You probably want a cardioid-type microphone for any kind of solo vocal or instrumental work, so that's what you're gonna find below. For your own edification, the word cardioid is a math term for a particular sort of regular plane curve which, it turns out, accurately represents the capture pattern of this kind of design.

There's also a small wrinkle to note, you will find so-called "[USB](#usb)" microphones all over the place now. This only means the microphone includes an integrated USB audio [interface](#interfaces) so you don't need to buy a separate one. Otherwise, the microphone itself will be one of the aforementioned types.

## Dynamic
Dynamic mics are probably the kind you're most familiar with. Due to their particular method of operation, they're far and away the most common kind of microphones used by touring musical groups as they're more resistant to feedback and easier to make in a durable way without losses in audio quality. They also tend to be cheaper as their design tends to be less exotic and easier to build.

##### Shure SM58-LC Vocal (~$100)

[Product Page](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Shure-SM58-LC-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0179T2CM8) | [Guitar Center](http://www.guitarcenter.com/Shure/SM58-Dynamic-Handheld-Vocal-Microphone.gc)

The myth. The legend. The Shure SM58 is perhaps, pound for pound, the greatest microphone ever created. If you've ever heard live music, the vocals were almost certainly going through a Shure SM58. If you've ever known someone that had to travel with microphones and trust them at the other end, they probably carried Shure SM58s. The Shure SM58 is rugged, it's sonically forgiving and it's easy to work with. There are mics that sound better, but there is no microphone in the world with the reputation for dependability of the SM58. The sound features a slight midrange boost for warmer sounding vocals and the cardioid directionality makes sure you only record what you want with minimal background noise. The ice cream cone shape is an integrated wind/pop filter so it's quite literally a one stop shop for quality sound capture.

ElFurbe Says: If you don't want to think about this at all even a little, buy this microphone. It will do exactly what you think it should. You will never regret it. You will never be disappointed in it. You will never break it. This is a 100% no-brainer choice unless you really know what you're doing or you really want to experiment with other mics because you already have or have used this one. If neither of those things is true, you're doing it wrong.

##### Shure SM48-LC Vocal (~$50)
![Shure SM48-LC Vocal](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJk9T0aJL._SL1500_.jpg){:height="400px"}

[Product Page](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm48-vocal-microphone) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0002D0HY4/) | [Guitar Center](http://www.guitarcenter.com/Shure/SM48-Cardioid-Dynamic-Vocal-Microphone.gc)

So, here's the thing. Everything said above about the [SM58](#shure-sm58-lc-vocal) is factual truthiness of the highest order. It is legen-wait for it-dary with like four "ary"s. But here's the thing. The SM48 is, like, 80% as good at 1/2 the price. The sound is similar but worse in ways you probably don't care about and it's a little less sturdy.

ElFurbe Says: Will you notice the difference between the SM48 and the SM58? Probably not. But when this SM48 breaks or gives you trouble or you're recording something and you wish it sounded a little better, I want you to think about why you didn't just spend the extra money up front for the SM58.

##### AKG D5 (~$100)
![AKG D5](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71p85%2BPBBnL._SL1500_.jpg){:height="400px"}

[Product Page](https://www.akg.com/Microphones/Dynamic%20Microphones/D5.html) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/AKG-D5-Vocal-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000S5JKRQ) | [Guitar Center](http://www.guitarcenter.com/AKG/D5-Supercardioid-Handheld-Dynamic-Microphone.gc)

This is the AKG alternative to the Shure SM58. Generally speaking it tends to roll off a little less on the high and low end than the SM58. Otherwise, pretty much same-same.

ElFurbe Says: Is it probably just as good as the SM58 and potentially better in some respects? Yes. Should you get it instead of the SM58? Nope. Nope nope nope.

## Condenser
Condenser mics are the second most popular type. They're more typically found in recording studios than live performances and on the whole tend to be more expensive, more complex and less sturdy. On the plus side, they are generally more sensitive and capture better quality audio with more dynamic range and better frequency extension. If you feel like you know enough not to be buying the Shure SM58, this is the category you should be looking at next. Do note, these microphones will always require power, either Phantom Power from your mixer or some sort of internal battery power, depending on the microphone.

##### AKG P120 (~$100)
![AKG P120](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GXGC-gUtL._SL1500_.jpg){:height="400px"}

[Product Page](http://www.akg.com/Microphones/Condenser%20Microphones/P120_.html?dwvar_P120___color=Black#start=1) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/AKG-P120-High-Performance-Recording-Microphone/dp/B00M9CUOKI) | [Guitar Center](http://www.guitarcenter.com/AKG/P120-Project-Studio-Condenser-Microphone.gc)

The AKG P120 is about as entry-level as you should go on condenser microphones for vocal work. Any cheaper and you're not getting the value of the technology. This is still a cardioid pattern microphone but it's a front-address style, so you talk into it from the side rather than from the top, which means you'll almost certainly want some kind of stand instead of going hand-held. Overall, this mic gives you the basic sound advantages of a condenser, meaning wider frequency response and better dynamic range, with virtually no audio drawbacks. It is not as sturdy as the SM58 so you'll need to handle it with more care. This mic also features a switchable bass cut filter to reduce annoying low frequency artifacts and a switchable attenuation pad which basically just makes the whole thing quieter in case your recording target has very high gain or very high sensitivity.

ElFurbe Says: This is the mic I have. I love it. I, personally, would not trade it for an SM58 under any circumstances for what I do with a microphone. YOU, reader, should keep in mind that I am:
  - Single
  - Childless
  - A Technology Nerd
  - Sonically picky at an OCD level
  - Fucking insufferable about getting weird things instead of what everyone else gets

Those factors create a strong case for getting this more fussy/less rugged option over the SM58. Should you follow me into this void? Up to you.

## USB
USB mics are basically microphone/[interface](interfaces.md) combination products. They can be all you need to get going, but as a rule of thumb, you'll trade some amount of audio quality and flexibility to get that convenience.

ElFurbe Says: I've never used one of these, I'm too much of a sperg to trust them. I'll list ones I know have good reputations but I can't endorse them at all.

##### Blue Yeti (~$125)

[Product Page](http://www.bluemic.com/products/yeti/) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2)

The Blue Yeti is a podcast gear legend. It solves many problems well, it's good quality, it's got a good reputation among hardened users and it's reasonably priced. If you don't want to buy ANYTHING else and get right into recording your voice for the streaming, this is that product.
