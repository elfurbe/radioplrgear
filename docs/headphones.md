# Headphones
Fuckin' headphones. Are they super important to your streaming setup, no. They really aren't. You defintely want to use headphones while you're recording for feedback reasons, but do they need to be particularly good? No, they really don't. You'll just want something that keeps the sound in your ears and not feeding back into the microphone. Basically anything you have probably meets that criteria in practical terms, even the shit crap garbage that came in the box with whatever phone you use is probably _sufficient_, it'll just sound very bad. You do not need to read the rest of this if you don't care about it sounding good in your ears, just definitely use headphones.

If you're still here, strap the hell in. I (ElFurbe) own so many headphones it's probably a war crime in some country somewhere, so I have many thoughts. Others will hopefully add their favorites in here as well.

There are really three major categories of headphone based on the way they fit you:
  - Over-ears are the largest, they go all the way around your ear, the pads will rest against the side of your head and your ears will be somewhat sealed inside with the driver.
  - On-ears sit directly on your outer ear and don't seal at all, really.
  - In-ears fit in the ear to some degree, with higher levels of seal and canal-depth generally creating better sound. Within the in-ear category, there are some subtypes that differentiate in fit:
    - Ear buds are the things that come with most cell phones that are little nubs that just rest in your ear and do not seal at all.
    - Universal in-ear monitors (UIEMs) will use some sort of foam or silicone tip to attempt to seal your ear canal reducing outside noise and increasing the effective impact of the drivers.
    - Custom in-ear monitors (CIEMs) have bodies created from audiologist moulds of your actual ear canal which allows them to perfectly contour to the shape of your ear and provide the best possible seal.

Within these fit types, there are also different kinds of speakers, commonly called drivers in headphone-speak:
  - Dynamic drivers are essentially small versions of the same speakers you'd find on a big hifi unit. They tend to be cheap, easy to manufacture, move the most air volume, and they're the most widely produced kind of driver overall. They use an electromagnet coupled to a diaphram (voice coil), suspended near a strong permanent magnet. The audio signal is passed through the electromagnet which causes it to move toward or away from the permanent magnet, vibrating the diaphram which pushes air and makes sound.
  - Planar magnetic drivers use a very thin membrane with conductive traces suspended between sets of permanent magnets. When current is passed through the conductors on the membrane, it moves within the magnetic field of the permanent magnets which pushes air and makes sound.
  - Balanced armature drivers are typically only found in in-ear products as they can be made very small and require low power to operate. They function by passing the audio signal through a coil wrapped around one end of a flexible arm with permanent magnets on the other end. The flux generated in the arm by the audio signal passing through the coil causes the arm to deflect within the permanent magnets. This end of the arm is attached to a membrane which then vibrates, which pushes air and makes sound.
  - Electrostatic drivers use a membrane coated with conductive material suspended between two grids which are set up to exert equal, opposite forces on the membrane when charged electrically. The audio signal is passed through a step-up transformer and fed through the grids which causes the charged membrane to move which pushes air and makes sound.

All of these driver types have pros and cons but the general rules of thumb are:
  - Dynamic drivers are big and cheap but by virtue of their single diaphragm, they can have difficulty accurately re-creating the multiple frequencies of music simultaneously without distortion. However, by virtue of being the most common driver, they're very well understood and good dynamic drivers can be made to sound as good as anything else with sufficient application of time and money.
  - Planar magnetic drivers require a lot of power and the very small amount of movement in their diaphrams is a mixed bag. It often causes them to suffer at reproducing bass frequencies as the small amount of travel tends to produce a very limited amount of air movement which is generally necessary for good low-frequency reproduction. On the other hand, they tend to be very low distortion as the low deflection of the diaphragm means it can more easily transition between frequencies without any interference.
  - Balanced armature drivers are very sensitive and very low distortion, but due to their typically tiny diaphrams, they produce an extremely low amount of air movement. Their ideal situation is sealed into your ear canal as with IEMs or hearing aids where the total volume of air is small enough that their impact is meaningful. You will often find IEMs with multiple balanced armatures in multi-way setups, often dedicating one exclusively to bass frequencies.
  - Electrostatic drivers are super niche and require specialized amplifiers (generally paired with the speakers or headphones they drive) which generate very high-voltage output. As a result, they're typically quite expensive and not portable in any sense, even around your home, without effort. They're comparatively rare vs the other types and you should really not buy them unless you're just super keen to hear them.

## On-Ear
Don't buy on-ears. I'm not even listing any. They're dumb. Their only potential value is portability but you can get over-ears that sound better which are sufficiently portable. On-ears are wrong. Don't be wrong.
