# Interfaces
An audio interface is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and/or digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The ADC allows you to take an analog signal, like that from a microphone, and digitize it for use by a computer. The DAC allows you to take digital sound from the computer and output it to an analog destination, like a pair of headphones. The interfaces I'll be listing here do both of those things in one. The best way to break down interfaces is by their protocol with the computer, so you'll find [usb](#usb), [firewire](#firewire) and [thunderbolt](#tunderbolt) interfaces on the market. Generally speaking, USB is what you want, they're cheaper and easier to work with. Firewire is the next tier up and often feature more I/O channels with the computer and generally higher quality hardware. Thunderbolt is generally the top of the line. They will be the least compatible, the most expensive and generally feature the highest-grade hardware. In many cases, it's entirely possible to record and broadcast a Radio PLR show with nothing more than an audio interface. Mixers are optional, but can give you more control over some aspects of your sound design.

_Spoiler alert: you probably don't care about the mixer. Just get a good interface and see how it goes first._

## USB
This is what you want to buy. Just ignore the other kinds of interfaces, they're some next level shit. Even confirmed overspender ElFurbe uses a USB interface because the alternatives are so dumb to consider for hobby use. We're gonna focus on two in two out interfaces, but you'll find mention of some others in the comments.

Things to concern yourself with in a USB interface:
 - How many inputs and outputs do I need?
 - Does this interface require stupid drivers to work right?
 - Does this interface support my computer's operating system?
 - Does this interface support the outputs of my mixer?

##### Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (~$150)
![Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://us.focusrite.com/sites/default/files/resources/image/Scarlett-2i2_front-elevated.jpg){:width="400px"}

[Product Page](https://us.focusrite.com/usb-audio-interfaces/scarlett-2i2) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B01E6T56EA) | [Guitar Center](http://www.guitarcenter.com/Focusrite/Scarlett-2i2-2nd-Generation-USB-Audio-Interface.gc)

Focusrite is the player to beat in the USB interface world. They have rapidly become the 900lb gorilla of this market segment and for very good reason: you cannot beat them at their price point. Can't be done. The Scarlett 2i2 is their just above entry model and it is a stellar piece of audio hardware. High and low-z combo inputs, excellent microphone pres, phantom power, no software/drivers required for Windows or Mac.

ElFurbe Says: I should've gotten this. I didn't, but I should have. It is better in every way than the thing I got, except the inputs are in the front and I wanted them in the back. I gave up a lot on paper to get that ergonomic itch scratched, but I do what I want. You should not do what I did, you should buy this. I am not even kidding, everything else on this page is pretty much an also-ran. There is a slightly lower-end version of this called the [Solo](https://smile.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B01E6T56CM) that may be adequate if you only need one microphone and nothing else. I started with one but it's not as flexible as the 2i2 and I outgrew it when I went to my mixer. It's worth considering, but the 2i2 is a better bet long-term.

##### PreSonus Studio 26 (~$175)
![PreSonus Studio 26](https://pae-web.presonusmusic.com/uploads/products/media/images/presonus-studio_26-front_big.jpg){:width="400px"}

[Product Page](https://www.presonus.com/products/Studio-26) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/PreSonus-Studio-26-Audio-Interface/dp/B01N126D3W/) | [Guitar Center](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Presonus/Studio26-2x4-USB-20-24-bit-192-kHz-Audio-Interface.gc)

You will find some audiophile in any professional setting that thinks PreSonus is a magical audio wizard company with some secret sauce that sets them apart. That might have been true at some point in the past, but today, they're at best among a pack of legitimate competitors at every level. PreSonus makes good gear. This will sound good. Will it sound better than anything comparable? No. It won't.

ElFurbe Says: Fuckin' hell. Just stop reading, buy the Focusrite. Why are you doing this to yourself?

##### M-Audio M-Track 2X2M (~$150)
![M-Audio M-Track 2X2M](http://www.m-audio.com/assets/images/microsite/m-track2x2M/features/2.jpg){:width="400px"}

[Product Page](http://m-audio.com/m-tracks/2x2m) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/M-Audio-M-Track-2X2-Interface-24-bit/dp/B01FFH5YTO/) | [Guitar Center](http://www.guitarcenter.com/M-Audio/M-Track-C-Series-2x2M-USB-MIDI-Interface.gc)

M-Audio has long been a favorite of digital musicians as they were very early to the digital interface game. They were part of the Avid/Digidesign beast for a while, but they were sold back out to InMusic a few years ago. The M-Audio M-Box range was kept by Avid, so the prices on those have gone through the roof. This is the replacement line and it's fine. It's just as fine as PreSonus, probably.

ElFurbe Says: Don't fucking buy this. Buy the god damned Focusrite. Why are you still reading, just buy the Focusrite.

##### Mackie Onyx Producer 2•2 (~$150)
![Mackie Onyx Producer 2•2](http://mackie.com/sites/default/files/styles/model_img/public/producer_0.jpg?itok=TWn9qpRw){:width="400px"}

[Product Page](http://mackie.com/products/onyx-series-usb-interfaces) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Mackie-Onyx-Producer-2-2-Interface/dp/B076646D8H/) | [Guitar Center](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Mackie/Onyx-Producer-2x2-USB-Audio-Interface-with-MIDI.gc)

Mackie finally got into this USB interface game for real with the Onyx Producer 2•2. It's comparable in all meaningful ways with the Focusrite 2i2 and the PreSonus Studio 26. It's about the same price as the Focusrite, which is as much as you should ever pay since the Focusrite is the thing you should probably buy. If all the other Mackie Onyx gear is any indication, this probably sounds great but probably not any better than anything else at this price point.

ElFurbe Says: I swear, how did you even make it all the way down here? Did you think there might be a secret if you just stuck with it? Well, you're right. There is. This is the only interface I'm even mildly tempted to recommend instead of the Focusrite and that is purely because I _love_ the Onyx mic preamps. I love them. They make me so very happy. As I've never used this interface, I can't say how it is to work with. I have used the Focusrite and it's the bees, but I get along very well with my Mackie gear so I have no reason to believe this is bad. In fact, I'd wager it's very good. So maybe buy this. I mean, probably just buy the Focusrite, but maybe. Maybe this. _MAYBE_.

ElFurbe ALSO SAYS: UPDATE! I bought this cause I wanted to. That's it. My Blackjack is still working like a champ, but I wanted one with inputs in the front for other reasons and I figured now was my chance. Seems to work exactly as one might expect. There are a couple small peccadillos.

One, the HI-Z and +48V _buttons_ look like they're just _lights_ but they're buttons. Two, the Input/DAW mixer feature is a little, I don't know, weird. It's, like, sort of a way to do direct monitoring of the two inputs at the same time as the USB input I guess, but it's just, weird. It mixes the two together, as you'd expect, which means you can't clearly hear what either of them actually sound like. I don't know, I think a gain/volume knob for input from USB would've been equally useful if you're trying to direct monitor everything from the interface, but what do I know, I'm just some asshole on the internet.

I haven't A/B tested it against my Blackjack or my Onyx 1220 for mic recording quality, but it sounded good to me subjectively out of the box, so it's got that going for it. Updating _MAYBE_ to _Provisionally Equally Good Choice_.

##### Mackie Onyx Blackjack (~$100)
![Mackie Onyx Blackjack](https://www.thomann.de/pics/bdb/252197/8692974_800.jpg){:width="400px"}

[Product Page](http://mackie.com/products/onyx-blackjack) | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Mackie-Onyx-Blackjack-Recording-Interface/dp/B003VZG550/)

The Mackie Onyx Blackjack is a pretty bare-bones interface, but it has Onyx microphone pre-amps which is a real victory and all the I/O is in the back. It is generally speaking quite a bit worse on paper than most of the other options.

ElFurbe Says: If you're still reading to find out what I bought, this is it. I bought this. Why did I buy this? Well:
 1. It matches my mixer
 2. The I/O is all in the back so it's cleaner on my table
 3. It has the same pres as my mixer so I can use it standalone and know my mic sounds good
 4. I. DO. WHAT. I. WANT.

You should probably not buy this. You should buy the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2.
