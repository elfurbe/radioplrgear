# Interfaces
An audio interface is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and/or digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The ADC allows you to take an analog signal, like that from a microphone, and digitize it for use by a computer. The DAC allows you to take digital sound from the computer and output it to an analog destination, like a pair of headphones. The interfaces I'll be listing here do both of those things in one. The best way to break down interfaces is by their protocol with the computer, so you'll find [usb](#usb), [firewire](#firewire) and [thunderbolt](#tunderbolt) interfaces on the market. Generally speaking, USB is what you want, they're cheaper and easier to work with. Firewire is the next tier up and often feature more I/O channels with the computer and generally higher quality hardware. Thunderbolt is generally the top of the line. They will be the least compatible, the most expensive and generally feature the highest-grade hardware.

## USB
This is what you want to buy. Just ignore the other sections, they're for some next level shit. Even confirmed overspender ElFurbe uses a USB interface because the alternatives are dumb to consider for hobby use.
